            <h1>Introduction:</h1> 
            <p>Climate change refers to the long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. It can be done naturally such as volcanic eruptions, earthquake, etc. It can also be done by humans like burning fossil fuels such as oil, coal and more.
            </p>

            <h2>Problem</h2> 
            <p>The problem of this event is that it is not just affecting the Earth but also the people and animals inside it. Climate impacts are already harming health, through air pollution, disease, extreme weather events, forced displacement, pressures on mental health, and increased hunger and poor nutrition in places where people cannot grow or find sufficient food. More frequent and intense drought, storms, heat waves, rising sea levels, melting glaciers and warming oceans can directly harm animals, destroy the places they live, and wreak havoc on people's livelihoods and communities.</p>
        
            <h2>Solution</h2> 
            <p>Gender Equality and its properties MUST be included in the rules of basically everywhere so that the people around the area will follow as it is conducted in the rules. This way, there would not be much fuss about unequal treatment and it can help us make use of its impact in our daily lives. In other words, Gender Equality is often depicted as a REQUIREMENT in the rules to avoid violence.</p>
